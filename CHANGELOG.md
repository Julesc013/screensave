# Changelog

All notable repository changes are recorded here in series order.

## S01 - 2026-03-27

### Added

- GitHub community-health files including issue forms, issue-template configuration, a pull request template, and CODEOWNERS.
- Conservative GitHub Actions workflows for repository CI, docs health, and manual release scaffolding.
- Lightweight validation helpers under `tools/scripts/` for repository structure, Codex config, docs basics, and release-scaffold checks.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with repository boundaries, series expectations, and verification rules.

### Changed

- Updated repository truth-bearing docs to reflect the governance-focused Series 01 state.
- Updated roadmap material so Series 01 now describes governance and CI foundation work instead of the earlier placeholder plan.

### Validation

- Confirmed Series 00 prerequisites existed before changes.
- Validated the new governance files, Codex config, docs basics, and release scaffold inputs with the new helper scripts.
- Confirmed the series added no runtime implementation, build system logic, packaging logic, or release publishing.

### Added

- Permanent repository skeleton for platform, products, assets, tests, validation, tools, build, packaging, and third-party records.

- Project-scoped Codex control plane in `.codex/config.toml` and `.codex/agents/*.toml`.
- Normative specifications for compatibility, saver API, renderer rules, build targets, release readiness, and config boundaries.
- Explanatory architecture, roadmap, and lineup documentation under `docs/`.

### Changed

- Rewrote the root `README.md` into the permanent Series 00 landing page.
- Replaced the earlier temporary bootstrap layout with the long-term repository structure required by the prompt program.

### Validation

- Reviewed repository structure against the Series 00 directory contract.
